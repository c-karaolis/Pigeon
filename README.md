I caught myself a lot of times wanting to just dump a JSON and a URL  really fast to do a POST request and test a response from an API. The heavyweights' (Postman , ReadyAPI etc.) GUI is giving me anxiety nowadays with all the  fancy shmancy and complicated elements laying all over my screen*, so i created pigeon for a much more simplistic experience for my use case.

*Do not get me wrong I really love these tools and use them a lot. I just some times want to throw a json string in there and press a button without creating collections etc. Depends on the use case.


I am open-sourcing it in case someone finds it useful.

PUT request is not implemented. I have no personal use for it at the moment.

I will update and add a feature to the project mostly if I have a need for it while using the client.

Project took ~5 hours.

The project is totally not tested. The only assertion I can make is that it just works for me on my machine. :)
