# Pigeon
 Lightweight HTTP request portable client.

I caught myself a lot of times wanting to just dump a JSON and a URL  really fast to POST and test a response from an API. The heavyweights' (Postman , ReadyAPI etc.) GUI is giving me anxiety nowadays with all the  fancy shmancy and complicated elements laying all over my screen, so i created pigeon for a much more simplistic experience for my use case.

I open-sourcing it in case someone finds it useful.

Project took me ~3 hours.
